The files in this directory originated with Joao Cardoso's 2003
download of Pavel Sakov's csa library which was immediately stripped
down by Joao to just the parts he needed to help implement the
plgriddata API for the 'plplot' C library.  The PLplot development
team have been maintaining that stripped version of the csa library
ever since with no further contribution (except for the new LICENSE
text referred to below) from Pavel Sakov.

As of 2017-07-11 Pavel Sakov gave us permission to update the license
of our stripped version of csa to be the same as the current licence
of his modern csa version which we cut and pasted on that date from
<https://github.com/sakov/csa-c/blob/master/csa/LICENSE> and stored in
the LICENSE file in this directory.  The only additional changes we
have made to that file are to add additional lines to the copyright
notice at the top reflecting Joao Cardoso's initial commit in 2003 and
the further commits since then (as recorded in our software repository
log) to this stripped version of the csa library by him and other
members of the PLplot development team.
