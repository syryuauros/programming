     *  \brief a class for polar plots
     *
     *  A class for polar plots. Construction requires
     *  a single PlotDataPolar (which derives from PlotData2D) dataset, meaning it is not possible to generate an empty plot.
     *  Afterwards, other datasets may be added using the add_data() method.
     *  The \c x and \c y class variables of PlotData2D will when used with this class be interpreted
     *  to correspond to the radial coordinate (usually denoted as \c r) and the angular coordinate (usually denoted as \c Î¸), respectively.
     *  Several properties may be set such as the axes and plot titles.
     *  Important is that whenever a property is changed, \c signal_changed() is emitted, which will eventually
     *  be picked up by the \c canvas that will hold the plot.
     *  An example of this class is presented in \ref example6.
