     *  \brief a class that will hold a single dataset and its properties for a Plot3D plot
     *
     *  Instances of this class contain a single dataset for a Plot3D three-dimensional plot,
     *  consisting of the raw X-, Y- and Z-data, along with a number of properties that will determine
     *  the appearance of the plot. Data may be represented as a line, symbols or both.
     *  The constructors of this class allow to use either std::vector or std::valarray as sources of data,
     *  for added flexibility. Internally they are stored only as std::vector though.
     *  Important is that whenever a property is changed, \c signal_changed() is emitted, which will eventually
     *  be picked up by the \c canvas that will hold the plot.
     *  Several of the methods that are offered by this class are demonstrated in \ref example9.
